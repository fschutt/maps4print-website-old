# maps4print-website-old

This is the old code for the website http://www.maps4print.com

I rewrote the whole code after realizing that I could not achieve my goals without a framework. 
However, this is my best "pure" PHP so far.

To install, simply download the code, start PHP, open index.php. 
The project does not use any external libraries.

This code is open-source because there is no use for it, currently. I have since refactored the 
CSS files into SCSS. The current website still runs on PHP, but frameworks make things much easier.
